# Experiments

This directory contains experimental code snippets, technique explorations, and work-in-progress ideas.

## Purpose

Use this space for:
- Testing new Strudel functions and features
- Exploring algorithmic music concepts
- Quick sketches and ideas
- Learning exercises

## Organization

Files here don't need to be complete compositions - they can be:
- Short code snippets demonstrating a technique
- Parameter exploration studies
- Sound design experiments
- Rhythm pattern tests

Feel free to be messy and experimental here!
